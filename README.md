# 🤩 Sneaker Shop 🤩 

We are a team of three, Leo, Ralf and Egon, who have come together to create a sneaker shop website. 
🛒 This website is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and its purpose is to provide an online store for sneaker enthusiasts to purchase their favourite kicks. 
🧦 Our team has divided the work between us, and each of us has contributed to the project in the same way. 
🤝 We have all worked together to create the best sneaker shop website possible. 
🤩 Check out our site and start stocking up on new shoes today! 🔥
